The Strength in Starting Small
Big changes can feel overwhelming — but starting small makes them possible. A single step may not seem like much, but it builds momentum, confidence, and clarity along the way.

Starting small removes the pressure to be perfect. It allows room for learning, mistakes, and progress without fear. It shifts the mindset from “all or nothing” to “step by step.”

Each small action adds up. Over time, it creates habits, routines, and visible results. What once felt out of reach becomes manageable through consistent effort.

The strength in starting small lies in its simplicity. It teaches that growth isn’t about speed — it’s about direction and persistence.
