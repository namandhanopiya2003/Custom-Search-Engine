How Routines Create a Sense of Control
Routines aren’t just about structure — they’re about creating a sense of control in an unpredictable world. When daily actions become consistent, they provide mental stability and reduce decision fatigue.

A good routine sets the tone for the day. It creates rhythm, allowing you to move from task to task with greater ease. Even small routines, like how you begin or end your day, can have a big emotional impact.

Routines also protect your time and energy. They reduce distractions and increase awareness of where your effort is going. Over time, this leads to better focus and more meaningful progress.

By designing routines that align with your values, you gain a sense of direction. Life feels less reactive, and more intentional.
